"Open your shop." We said. "Stop having it be closed."

## What?
The Open Shop Channel is an alternative to The Wii Shop Channel and Homebrew Downloaders.

## Why?
With the Wii Shop Channel's closure in 2019 and Homebrew Repo services becoming outdated, The Open Shop Channel's purpose is to give both Homebrew Developers and Users a more comfortable experience.

## Contributions
Please test changes before pulling, and add screenshots to issues and pull requests.

## How?
We still need to figure out which delivery method is best. So far we have a WAD Patcher and/or private distribution of OSC WAD.

## Who?
We are a group of homebrew fans that want to provide the easiest way to get homebrew in the safest way possible.
The team so far consists of darky, dhtdht020, KcrPL, Larsenv and CornierKhan1.

## When?
The release date of The Open Shop Channel is unfortunately unknown.
